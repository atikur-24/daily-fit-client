### Front-end Features
1.<b>User Registration and Class Selection:</b> Allow users to create an account on the website and provide them with the ability to browse and select gym classes. Implement a "Classes" section where users can view all available classes and have a "Select" button to choose the classes they want to enroll in

2.<b>Student Dashboard:</b> Create a personalized dashboard for students where they can see their selected classes. Include a "Pay" button for each selected class, allowing students to make payments for the classes they have chosen. Also, incorporate a "My Enrolled Classes" section that displays the classes in which the student has successfully enrolled.

3.<b>Seat Availability and Enrollment Management:</b> Implement a system that keeps track of the available seats for each class. When a student enrolls in a class, reduce the available seats by 1 and update the enrolled student count. Make sure to display the updated seat availability information to other users to avoid over-enrollment.

4.<b>Trainer Dashboard:</b> Create a section specifically for trainers where they can add new gym classes to the system. Allow trainers to view and manage their own classes, including class details, schedules, and participant lists.

5.<b>Admin Dashboard:</b> Develop an admin dashboard with various administrative functionalities. Provide an interface to manage classes, including approving or denying class submissions and handling user feedback. Implement user management features where the admin can view and manage all users, including students, trainers, and other admins. Include the ability to promote users to admin status if needed.
